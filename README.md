In our multiplayer game, players will work together to survive as bubbles drop down on them. Upon touching a bubble a player will lose a life. Players start with 5 lives each. Each player is equipped with a special weapon which can be used to pop the bubbles. Players can accumulate points by popping bubbles. Upon reaching a certain number of points players guns will automatically be upgraded allowing them to shoot faster, and pop more bubbles per shot. As the levels progress the difficulty level will increase, as in the bubbles will grow in size and number. The game consists of X levels, by surviving all X levels a player will have completed the game. Happy popping!
