Bubble Popper is a two-player arcade game that's still in development process. 

In our game, players will work *together* in order to survive as bubbles drop down on them. Upon touching a bubble, a player will lose a life. Players start with 5 lives each. Each player is equipped with a special weapon which can be used to pop the bubbles. Players can accumulate points by popping bubbles using their guns and upon reaching a certain number of points, players' guns will automatically be upgraded allowing them to shoot faster, and pop more bubbles per shot. As the levels progress the difficulty level will increase, as in the bubbles will grow in size and number. There will also be mirrors that'll act like wormholes. 

The game consists of X levels, by surviving all X levels a player will have completed the game. Happy popping!
